Oh hai there! Are you a biologist who spends *way* too much time copying and pasting data in Microsoft Excel? I was like you too once, before I found the light and started practising awesome reproducible research with R.

Over the course of my PhD I made many a handy little script for data wrangling the outputs of various experiments, icluding qPCR and ELISA plates, CLAMS data (and a link) and more. Ater many years living in various folders and subfolders, being copied and *slightly* modified (and then trying to find which modified copy I wanted), they finally have a home on the internet!

## Installation

You can install the released version of handytools using devtools:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("mattsnelson/handytools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: (to fill in later -? one for each script)

``` r
library(handytools)
## basic example code
```
