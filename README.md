Oh hai there! Are you a biologist who spends *way* too much time copying and pasting data in Microsoft Excel? I was like you too once, before I found the light and started practising awesome reproducible research with R.

Over the course of my PhD I made many a handy little script for data wrangling the outputs of various experiments, icluding qPCR and ELISA plates, CLAMS data (and a link) and more. Ater many years living in various folders and subfolders, being copied and *slightly* modified (and then trying to find which modified copy I wanted), they finally have a home on the internet!

## Installation

You can install the released version of handytools using devtools:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("mattsnelson/handytools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: (to fill in later -? one for each script)

``` r
library(handytools)
## basic example code
```

### elisr

TODO: add in description

### rna2cdna

takes qiaxpert input and checks for quality and batch effects.

calculates water and RNA to add into cDNA synthesis reaction

TODO: update this with an example/figure

TODO: make this a markdown table:

Qulaity Score   A260/A280
HIGH   > 2.0
GOOD   1.8 - 2.0
FAIR   1.7 - 1.8
POOR   1.6 - 1.7
BAD    < 1.6

Example code to get output:
``` r
cdna_synthesis <- handytools::rna2cdna(rna_conc)
ggplot(cdna_synthesis, aes(rna_extraction_batch)) + geom_bar(aes(fill=RNA_quality_rating))
```

add here: example of table.

### cdna_plan_printable

takes the output of the above cDNA synthesis paln and just makes it more readable (and printable so can have a hardcopy for going into the lab)
